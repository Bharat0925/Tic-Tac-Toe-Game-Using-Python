# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Using-Python
The game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic two-player game typically played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal on the grid.

Here are the basic rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid (9 cells).

2. Two players take turns, one using "X" and the other using "O," to place their symbol in an empty cell.

3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

4. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie (a "cat's game").

5. Players take turns until the game ends, either in a win, a tie, or a draw.

The game is simple but can be quite strategic. To win, a player needs to block their opponent while trying to create their own winning combination. The key to success is thinking ahead and anticipating the opponent's moves.

Here's an example of a Tic-Tac-Toe game board:

```
 1 | 2 | 3 
---|---|---
 4 | 5 | 6 
---|---|---
 7 | 8 | 9 
```

Players take turns choosing a number (1-9) to place their symbol in the corresponding cell. The goal is to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Here's an example of a winning combination for "X" in the center column:

```
 X |   | X 
---|---|---
 X | X | O 
---|---|---
 O | O | X 
```

In this example, "X" wins by having three in a diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right and a vertical column in the center.

Tic-Tac-Toe is often used as a simple example in programming tutorials and AI development, making it a well-known and frequently implemented game.
